It supports historical data analysis, predictive alerts, and community coordination between residents, neighborhood watch groups, and law enforcement.

## Problem 1: Fragmented Crime Reporting and Lack of Real-Time Communication

Current crime reporting in the Kitchener/Waterloo Region is disjointed, leading to under-reporting, delayed law enforcement responses, and missed opportunities for trend analysis and prevention.

### ✅ Requirement 1: Real-Time Crime Reporting
- Users can report incidents with multimedia, location, and timestamps.
- **Outcome:** Residents report faster and more accurately.

### ✅ Requirement 2: Interactive Incident Map
- Map with filters by type, date, and location.
- Toggle between real-time and historical view.
- **Outcome:** Better visibility into local safety issues.

### ✅ Requirement 3: Historical Crime Data and Trend Analysis
- Dashboard with visualizations: heatmaps, graphs, etc.
- Data filtering and export available to residents and officials.
- **Outcome:** Informed decision-making based on past patterns.

### ✅ Requirement 4: Predictive Alerts for High-Risk Zones
- Machine learning for forecasting incidents.
- Customizable safety alerts.
- **Outcome:** Proactive community and law enforcement responses.

### ✅ Requirement 5: Two-Way Communication
- Secure messaging between users and authorities per report.
- Status updates and response tracking.
- **Outcome:** Increased transparency and user engagement.

### ✅ Requirement 6: Neighborhood Alert Board
- Bulletin board for non-criminal community updates (e.g., lost pets, safety tips).
- Moderation tools for admin control.
- **Outcome:** Community engagement and broader safety awareness.
